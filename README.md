# aBetterModpack

A Better Modpack created for Lethal Company. Initially released to help my friends download all the necessary mods to play
in a stable environment together, especially those who have entry-level computers. This modpack features many different fun 
and quality of life mods such as Mimics' and Skinwalkers to better scroll wheel, additional item slots, suits and emotes! 
This modpack is still in development and will be releasing more stable versions of the current mods in the near future.
